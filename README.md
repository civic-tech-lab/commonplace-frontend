# CommonPlace

### Overview
This is the frontend repository for Civic Tech's [CommonPlace](http://civictech.us/commonplace/) project. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and has not been ejected yet.  You can find more info about the tools and packages used in the Create React App docs.


### Setup
Clone the repo and install the dependencies with either `yarn` or `npm install`. In the following examples, `yarn` and `npm` can be used interchangeably.

To run the project in development, run `yarn start`.

Additionally, if you are styling/making changes to SCSS files you will need to run `yarn run watch-css` in a separate terminal window.

NOTE: Do not write directly into `.css` files because accompanying `.scss` files will overwrite them when they compile.

### Build
To build the project, run `yarn build`.

### Testing
Unit tests use Enzyme and Jest and can be run with `yarn test`.
